# chrome-ctrl-scroll

Use Ctrl+Wheel to scroll by a larger amount, instead of the default zoom behaviour.

I came up with this feature for my [code editor](//github.com/gushogg-blake/edita) and found it much more valuable than the zoom behaviour.

## Installation

Download this repo somewhere, enable Developer mode in extensions, and click "Load unpacked" and point it to the donwloaded folder.

## Customisation

Adjust the behaviour to your liking by modifying the constants in [src/ctrl-scroll.js](./src/ctrl-scroll.js).
