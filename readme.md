# chrome-ctrl-scroll

Use Ctrl+Wheel to scroll by a larger amount, instead of the default zoom behaviour.

I came up with this feature for my [code editor](//github.com/gushogg-blake/edita) and found it much more valuable than the zoom behaviour.

## Installation

Clone the repo and then add `--load-extension=/path/to/chrome-ctrl-scroll` to the launcher for Chrome/Brave.

## Customisation

Adjust the behaviour to your liking by modifying the constants in [src/ctrl-scroll.js](./src/ctrl-scroll.js).
